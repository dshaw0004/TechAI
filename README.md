# TechAI Settings - Single Page Application

This project is a responsive single-page frontend application simulating a user settings interface, built purely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It replicates the design provided in the Figma file.

## Features

*   **Single Page Application (SPA):** Content changes dynamically without full page reloads.
*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts smoothly to desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes.
*   **Fixed Sidebar (Desktop):** Provides consistent navigation.
*   **Toggleable Sidebar (Mobile):** Accessible via a hamburger menu icon.
*   **Dynamic Content Loading:** Clicking sidebar tabs updates the main content area.
*   **Visual Fidelity:** Aims to match the layout, colors, fonts, and components shown in the Figma design.
*   **Interactive Elements:** Includes functional toggles, password visibility icons, and copy-to-clipboard buttons.

## Pages Implemented

1.  **Profile Settings:** Manage personal info, contact details, profile picture, and account preferences.
2.  **Change Password:** Update password and manage security options (2FA, expiration, notifications).
3.  **Default Settings:** Configure system-wide preferences for display, language, AI processing, and performance.
4.  **Notification Settings:** Control email, in-app, and push notification preferences and scheduling.
5.  **Data and Privacy:** Manage data download/clearing, privacy controls (sharing, analytics, cookies), and account deletion.
6.  **Integration Settings:** Configure integrations like Email SMTP and view Webhook URLs.
